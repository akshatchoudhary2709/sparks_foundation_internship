            <h3>DONATION</h3>
        <P>A donation is a gift for charity, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, alms, services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A donation may satisfy medical needs such as blood or organs for transplant.</P>

        <h3>WHY DONATION IS IMPORTANT?</h3>
        <p>Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.</p>

        <h3>YOUR DONATION CAN CHANGE SOMEONE'S LIFE</h3>
        <p>You might think about charity as something you do with the extra change you find lying around, or by supporting a friend running in a local race. That's how we used to feel â€” until we learned how much even a modest amount of charity can accomplish when given to the right organizations.
It's common for charities to make big promises, and in most cases they can't deliver. But after researching hundreds of charities and the programs they carry out, we've found a few that can truly demonstrate impact. With these charities, your donation can make a real difference.</p></main>
